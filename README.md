# Radar-signal-conversion-algorithm
The algorithm is used as part of a software and measurement complex aimed at calculating the amplitude-frequency characteristics of a blade. It is implemented on the basis of a radar device
Radar systems use probing radiation with a wavelength 3-4 orders of magnitude longer than that of laser systems. Therefore, in comparison with the latter, they are more resistant to the effects of the listed interfering factors and provide sufficient measurement accuracy in a number of applications. Thus, one can point out positive differences from contact sensors and laser systems. On the one hand, the device is contactless, i.e. it does not distort the operation of the object under study and allows measuring deformations and vibrations in places where it is impossible to attach sensors. On the other hand, obtaining information is possible in smoke and dust, which are inevitable during the operation of engines or other power equipment, where neither contact sensors nor laser systems operate. It should be added that the microwave probing method imposes much more lenient requirements on the quality of the reflective surface of the controlled object than in laser systems.
